# Comet-Orbit-Simulation
This project simulates the orbital motion of a comet using Keplerian elements.  
It demonstrates the highly elliptical path of a comet around the Sun, along with the influence of Jupiter’s orbit.
# Comet.py

## Features
- Visualizes the comet’s orbit with:
- Perihelion (closest point to the Sun)
- Aphelion (farthest point from the Sun)
- The Sun at the center
- Jupiter’s orbit for reference

- Defines and uses Keplerian elements:
- Semi-major axis
- High eccentricity (very elliptical orbit)
- Inclination (retrograde orbit)
- Argument of periapsis
- Longitude of ascending node
- Mean anomaly at epoch
- Provides an educational look at orbital mechanics, including how cometary orbits differ from planetary orbits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Common scientific libraries:  
  - `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mansurby/Comet.py.git
   cd comet-orbit
pip install -r requirements.txt
python comet.py
   cd Comet.py
